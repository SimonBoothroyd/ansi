-- 0042_drop_default_measure.sql — the retired default-measure machinery goes.
--
-- ADR-0015 replaced `ingredient.default_measure_id` (0023) with
-- `ingredient.piece_basis_amount`: a piece weight is a NUMBER on the row, and
-- 0039 copied every default measure's basis amount across as it applied. The
-- column, its own-measure trigger, its partial index, the frozen-curation
-- backfill and the two carry statements inside `ensure_onboarded()` were kept
-- for one release so the data stayed readable; no client has read any of them
-- since, the generated seed never writes them, and several releases have
-- shipped on the piece weight. Dead schema reads as live schema — a reader
-- finds two answers to "what does a bare count mean" — so it goes.
--
-- Nothing is lost that anything reads: the piece weight already carries the
-- fact. DATA IS DURABLE (docs/cloud-setup.md §2c) and this is a schema drop,
-- so it lands only on the owner's call.
--
-- SYNC. The client schema (`app/lib/core/sync/schema.dart`) never declared
-- the column after 0039, and both sync-rule files are `select * from
-- ingredient`, so nothing changes on the wire.
